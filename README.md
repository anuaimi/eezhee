# Eezhee 

A tool to make it easy to build production platforms and deploy an app

## Status
Still early days.  Have just started this repo.  Will start with bash scripts and once we are comfortable with what we want to do, will convert to golang CLI tool. 

Right not, there is very little in this repo

## Usage

To build a VM on digitalocean, use 

```bash
eezhee.sh build 
```
